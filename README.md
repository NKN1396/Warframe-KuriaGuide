### Guidelines

#### Copyrighted and trademark material

In order to keep this guide free and accessible, I will only accept material under the following conditions:
1. There must be no visible clan emblems / sigils.
2. There must be no visible player names.
3. No credit or attribution shall be in the guide.

#### Image quality standards

1. Resolution should be at least 1920 x 1080 at 100% scale.
2. Provide enough material to identify the room. Recognizing if you're in the correct room seems to be the hard part. The guide focuses on that.
3. As little images as possible. If the Kuria is reasonably easy to find and access, there is no need to show the exact position (e.g. a close-up). Contrary, if a Kuria requires tricky maneuvering, every step should have its own image.
4. Kurias should be marked (g) in every image.

#### Text quality standards

1. Avoid opinios (e.g. "this room is easy to identify") and stick to a more objective approach.
2. Trivia and fillers are okay, as long as they're tagged in italics (`[i]``[/i]`).

## Licensing

For the time being, I do not provide a license for any part of this guide.
In other words: all rights reserved.

There is some legal stuff I need to figure out before I can change that.
I do plan to release parts under different licenses.
