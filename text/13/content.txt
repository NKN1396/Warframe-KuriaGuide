This Kuria was a big surprise to me, as I almost missed it. Scanned the entire room finding nothing and then suddenly hear it as I'm bullet-jumping out of the room. It can be found in the same room as the previous Kuria.

So after taking a lot of runs through Ceres in order to find new Kurias, Kebabthief told me he found a new one and tried to describe it. That was Kuria 12-2 but it made me remember this particular room with the three cranes which I only ever saw once. So after finishing a lot of missions on Ceres and almost giving up, thinking I did something wrong I FINALLY FOUND IT. This has to be (in my opinion) the rarest room I have encountered so far.

I immediately got a feeling the Kuria would be ontop of the cranes and there it was, smiling at me. It's pretty easy to get up there but from my memory of that room I was already so sure I'd find it up there, it felt like fulfilling a prophecy.

This Kuria can be found in the exact same room as the Kuria above. Let me go ahead and tell you that I had to watch a video guide in order to find this one for the following reasons:
[list]
[*]This room is so rare, I saw it as my only chance to ever encounter it
[*]It's pretty big and I got a feeling there'd be two Kurias in this room
[*]Two consecutive Kurias still missing at that point reinforced my idea
[*]I was getting tired after searching for 10 minutes (enemies got annoying)
[/list]
I started watching the video and realized I was right: There absolutely is a Kuria in this room! I stopped the video before I knew where exactly to look (I just needed that motivation-boost) and searched it by myself...
for 30 minutes...
I did not find it.

Being disappointed in myself, I started up the video again but this time watched it in full length.
Out of all the Kurias I collected so far, all seemed fair in some way. Some were easy, others were hard, but I always felt like I achieved something. Every time my friends found a Kuria faster than me or got one that I missed it gave me motivation to try better next time.
BUT THIS KURIA...
It's more than 50 meters away from the next platform so it doesn't show up on the scanner.
It's up so high, the engine just fails the lighting and your character model turns black.
It's so far away from the enemies, they just stop moving at all.
It's just...
wrong.
I can't explain how to get up there, took me 5 minutes. Just try your best. Good luck.

One of the most recognizable rooms in Grineer Sealab-tileset. The Kuria is hidden pretty well and was a pain to search for. It's found high up on the pipes before walking up the slope. There's also a small hole in the wall near it.
This particular one is really confusing, I didn't expect it to be found in the Sealab-tileset, but on either Corpus Outpost or Grineer Settlement. It really throws me off, because it completely destroys the pattern I started to recognize... maybe it's just an exception.
