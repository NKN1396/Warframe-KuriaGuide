If you want to go hunting the Kurias by yourself, you should only read this section here. Anything below this section is probably spoilers (aside from the spoilers themselves).
There are two ways to pull this off:

[h3]The new way[/h3]
This one is straightforward, but I wouldn't call it the easy way. It requires a Warframe ability called 'Golden Instinct', which highlights Kurias and other rarities in your vicinity. The only issue is that you need to acquire pretty much every Warframe in the game.

[h3]The original way[/h3]
If you don't have Golden Instinct yet or you want to go through the experience of finding them the way we did, here's what helped us find almost all of them:
[olist]
[*]Turn up your sound effects-volume.
Kurias emit a distinctive sound you will be able to recognize after you've found a few. The best way to describe it is that they sound like they're "glowing" and emitting energy. Kind of like the Nirnroots in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Unlike those however you have to get closer in order to be able to hear them.
[*]Turn down your music-volume.
You don't want that annoying music to play over your glorious Kuria sounds. Seriously, they're super quiet.
[*]Don't forget codex scanners.
First of all: You will obviously need those in order to scan them.
Second: Like most scannable objects, unscanned Kurias glow when looking through the scanner (their glow however is gold/yellow like unscanned enemies, not green). Kurias you've already scanned won't get highlighted on your scanner anymore.
The scanning range is 50 meters, any Kurias (and objects in general) further away than that will neither be highlighted nor will you be able to scan them.
[*]Some Kurias appear in specific mission types only.
[*]Don't forget: Kurias can be [b]very well-hidden[/b].
You should always keep this in mind when searching form them. Don't give up your search simply because you're too sloppy. You can find Kurias in the most ridiculous places and often you will be blown away by the audacity DE had while placing them. [spoiler]That one Kuria near Earth extraction(!)[/spoiler]
[*]Speaking of audacious:
[spoiler]There are Kurias in underwater Archwing[/spoiler] and [spoiler]you can find more than one Kuria in a single room.[/spoiler]
[*]Trust your instinct.
While searching, we always cracked jokes that certain rooms must contain one. I'd say we were right about 50% of the time. If you feel like there might be something, it's probably worth investigating.
