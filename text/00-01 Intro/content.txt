This guide was dedicated to finding the 56 Kurias, little statuettes hidden inside various rooms in Warframe.
The guide was created in the process of finding all these Kurias myself and the help of my friends (because it's actually fun to find secrets, believe it or not). [b]It is actively maintained [u]with YOUR help[/u][/b].
Each scanned Kuria reveals a line of the poem (with a total of 14 stanzas with 4 lines each), adding to the lore of Warframe.

As of February 25th 2016 this guide is now complete.
