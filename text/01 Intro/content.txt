This guide is dedicated to assist you in finding the 56 Kurias, little statuettes hidden inside various rooms in Warframe. You can consider them as an easter-egg or a secret.
The guide was created in the process of finding all these Kurias by myself and with the help of friends (because it's actually quite fun to find secrets).

Each scanned Kuria reveals a line of the poem (with a total of 14 stanzas with 4 lines each), adding to the lore of Warframe.

Current status: As of May 26th 2019 I've decided to give this guide a long-needed overhaul. It is being worked on when time allows me to do so. [b]You[/b] can contribute to this guide by leaving tips in the comment section.
