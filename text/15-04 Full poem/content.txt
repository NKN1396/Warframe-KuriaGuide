[*]
A STORY ONCE LOST
RECOVERED BY FATE
THE TALE OF TWO SISTERS
WHO BORE THE SAME FACE

[*]
BORN ONE QUIET MORNING
AMIDST [b]THE[/b] GREAT WAR
ALL ELDERS WERE GATHERED
FOR THIS LIFE'S NEW DAWN

[*]
CONFUSED AND BEWILDERED
THEY JUDGED THEM AMISS
FOR THEY NEVER WITNESSED
TWO SELF-SAME AS THESE

[*]
A MIRRORED REFLECTION
HAD COME INTO LIFE
BY WILL OF THEIR FATHER
KEPT SAFE FROM THE KNIFE

[*]
THEIR SAMENESS WAS SHUNNED
AS SLAVE-LIKE AND SOILED
THEY TENDED THEIR STRAYS
REJECTED BY ALL

[*]
AS BOTH GIRLS MATURED
THEIR BOND GREW IN DEPTH
THEY HAD THE SAME POISE
SAME SENSES, SAME STRENGTH

[*]
THE UPRISING CAME
AND SPREAD LIKE A WEED
AN ARMY OF COPY-MEN
FEROCIOUS AND FREE

[*]
AND MUCH LIKE THE SEA
THEY CAME JUST LIKE WAVES
FOR YEARS THEY FOUGHT ON
FOR YEARS WE REMAINED

[*]
LIKE CHISEL TO STONE
WAR MOLDED THE TWINS
WHO RAVAGED THE HORDES
BECAME LEGEND TO THEM

[*]
THEY HAD A DEEP STRENGTH
THAT CAME FROM EACH OTHER
UNLIKE ALL THESE COPIES
IDENTICAL, BUT NOT BROTHERS

[*]
THE COPIES COULD SEE IT
THEY YEARNED FOR IT TOO
IF THE TWINS COULD DO IT
PERHAPS THEY COULD TOO

[*]
THE TWINS HAD ATTAINED
SOMETHING MORE THAN A WHOLE
A TRUE UNDERSTANDING
OF EACH OTHER SOUL

[*]
THE COPIES BECAME BELIEVERS
ONE BY ONE BOWED TO THE TWINS
AND LED FORTH BY THEIR NEW MASTERS
THEY RAVAGED THE COLONIES

[*]
NOW A POWER TO FOLLOW
NOT A FORCE TO BE FOUGHT
FROM THE ASHES OF WAR
THE TWIN QUEENS WERE WROUGHT
