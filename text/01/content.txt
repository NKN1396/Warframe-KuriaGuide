I've never seen this room before (but that could just be due to me mostly playing void missions) so I suspected it might hide a Kuria up pretty high. I was right.

Screenshot is finally here! Simply climb up the pipes and you will find the Kuria on top.

This Kuria was previously found in a Deception mission and has been moved to a new location. It is now located in one of the biggest, if not the biggest tileset in Warframe: the jungle on earth.

My best take on this would be searching for the waterfall and going to the second closest tree stump.

I really like this Kuria. I like to imagine how the Kuria fell in there from a high space and made the grinder stop because it's indestructable, it tells some kind of story. By the way, those grinders can crush a Tenno, just try it out by jumping into the working one right next to it ;)
Sadly this Kuria is not as awesome as it's predecessor. The old one was my favorite out of all 56 Kurias.

This Kuria was previously found in a Deception mission and has been moved to a new location. It is now found inside of one of the spy vaults on Earth.

Simply go up to the waterfall at the back of the room (easiest way to get there is by using the zipline).

The Kuria is in the room behind the corridor. Make sure not to get caught or hack the vault first. Thanks to Captain♥♥♥♥♥♥for pointing this one out (his name will probably get censored :P).
