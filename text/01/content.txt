I've never seen this room before (but that could just be due to me mostly playing void missions) so I suspected it might hide a Kuria up pretty high. I was right.

Screenshot is finally here! Simply climb up the pipes and you will find the Kuria on top.

This Kuria was previously found in a Deception mission and has been moved to a new location. It is now located in one of the biggest, if not the biggest tileset in Warframe: the jungle on earth.

My best take on this would be searching for the waterfall and going to the second closest tree stump.

I really like this Kuria. I like to imagine how the Kuria fell in there from a high space and made the grinder stop because it's indestructable, it tells some kind of story. By the way, those grinders can crush a Tenno, just try it out by jumping into the working one right next to it ;)
Sadly this Kuria is not as awesome as it's predecessor. The old one was my favorite out of all 56 Kurias.

I couldn't believe this one, because it was the first time I ever encountered two Kurias in the same room, which basically means I had to check every room again from that point on. This is also a more tricky one to get to. Start out on top of the building complex (the one hanging above the lava and where you have to insert the datamass) and start climbing the wall.
