I've seen some complaints about people not encountering certain Kurias/rooms at all.
The most mentioned ones are (top = rarest):
[list]
[*]12-2
[*]12-3
[*]13-2 & 13-3
[*]1-2
[*]6-3
[*]6-4
[/list]
[b]Yes[/b], these rooms are ridiculously rare.
[b]Yes[/b], I know it's frustrating.
[b]Yes[/b], I was having as much trouble as you finding them.
I (and a few other people) can only tell you the following: don't waste your time looking for that one Kuria and just run missions you want to do on that tileset. You will find it eventually.
