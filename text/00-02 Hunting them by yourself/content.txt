If you want to go hunting by yourself, here are some tips I can give to you:
[olist]
[*]Turn up your sound effects-volume.
Kurias emit a distinctive sound you will be able to recognize after you've found a few. The best way I can describe this is that they sound like they're "glowing" and emitting energy. Kind of like the Nirnroots in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Unlike those however you have to get really close in order to hear them.
[*]Turn down your music-volume.
You don't want that annoying music to play over your glorious Kuria sounds.
[*]Don't forget codex scanners.
First of all: You will obviously need those in order to scan them.
Second: Like most scannable objects, unscanned Kurias glow when looking through the scanner (their glow however is gold/yellow like unscanned enemies, not green). Kurias you've already scanned won't get highlighted on your scanner anymore.
The scanning range is 50 meters, any Kurias (and objects in general) further away than that will neither be highlighted nor will you be able to scan them.
[*]Some Kurias appear in specific mission types only.
[*]Don't forget: Kurias are very well-hidden.
You should always keep this in mind when searching form them. Don't give up your search simply because you're too sloppy. You can find Kurias in the most ridiculous places and often you will be blown away by the audacity DE had while placing them. [spoiler]That one Kuria near Earth extraction(!)[/spoiler]
[*]Speaking of audacious:
[spoiler]There are Kurias in underwater Archwing[/spoiler] and [spoiler]you can find more than one Kuria in a single room.[/spoiler]
[*]As of update 17.5 you can now mark Kurias for your teammates.
